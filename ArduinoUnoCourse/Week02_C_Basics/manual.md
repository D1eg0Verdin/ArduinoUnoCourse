# C Language Bootcamp

In week 1 we focuesed on binary and hex the real way computers store data. This week will be a shift in gears and we shall learn how we can begin to work to apply this knowledge by using **C**, one of the most widely used low-level language. 

It is assumed that students have some good java skills before going into this course but if not make sure to review all the syntax in detail as, synthatically C is very simalr to java. C, however, also removes some of Java's safety nets. Understanding C will be essential for working with hardware registers later in the course. 

Note the main bulk of the course work will be done in wokwi, however for this part of the course we need to use an IDE. I have chosen VSCode as it is versatile and getting used to it is important in my opinion. If your student is more comfortable somewhere else by all means use that. I have added a setup guide as to how setup VSCode for C.

## Final Mini-Project Goals
By the end of this manual students should be able to :
- Write, compile and run simple C programs
- Use variables, loops, conditionals and functions in C
- Understand how C differs from Java (no classes, manual memory, printf)
- build a simple binary counter program that displays numbers in decimal binary and hex
